# Beneath relay

- This page is only on behalf of personal views of Martha but not STEAM RELAY. 
- This page is about stuff behind the scenes. Such as how it happened, what the idea is, and why doing it this way. Call it relay logos if you want. 
- Those stuff are also open to you. 


## 0  What is relay

### 0.1  Naming of relay

Relay in EE means an electronic device functioning as a switch. From a mechanical perspective, it's like a lever, using a small signal to trigger a large current on or off. When it comes to STEAM RELAY, it means using STEAM ways to make real of an idea. Ideas in mind are the signals without actual strength, but with our relay, we hope we can make it real. 

### 0.2  Relay is the point

The central idea of STEAM RELAY is relay but not STEAM. That is, the connection of people, the connection of ideas and reality. STEAM *(Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math)* is the approach of connection-making but would not be the end of the story. 

Started by Martha, inevitably relay is **personal**. However, the reason for launching relay is to make it **interpersonal**. There was, is, or will not be any huge aspiration of relay, but all those works form the stony part of Martha's life. 




## 1  Service-based operation

### 1.1  Roads to relay 

*(history that doesn't matter much)*

The strength of changing the world is all that matters for most of things. This rule applies to relay. 

Currently, Martha's main social role is technician. Martha believes manufacturing ability is the core of being a technician in an educational institution. GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) as told. If possible she would like to be an apprentice but that's what didn't happen. She groped in greyness and assigned project practices. Until FDM came in, that's it, she thought. 

In the beginning of 2023, she learned and tried FDM for a while thus ready to build a VORON. The basis of being a technician is capable of operating machines and tools. To go further, is capable of understanding and building even designing machines. Not necessarily being a mechanical engineer or even a full-stack engineer, but an all-touched technician. To make it, building a VORON2.4 was her commitment. She made it. She's proud of being a VORON builder (V2.5343). Love you, VORONDESIGN Team.

At this point, the strength was solid. The next step is to link her strength to people around. 

### 1.2  Service provision

*(about why started with providing services)*

The ability to manufacture using FDM as a lab technician applied to fixing broken parts and making parts/upgrades of all kinds of lab stuff. 

The more powerful Martha feels FDM is, the more she wants to share this ability with people around. She is not a social person, rather she prefers to play alone. She knows that's narrow-minded. And STEAM RELAY is the chance, is the way out of playing alone. By providing services, she believes chances are, people around can enjoy happy printing and feel the wonderful sense of turning ideas into real things. 

To start off, providing services may be the most realistic way of building relay. Everybody has their own business. Martha doesn't expect to draw attention from people to her obsession. Only when people around can actually see the benefits and worked cases, they might be connected to me. 

Life is about connection, isn't it. Her life is no exception. 


## 2  FDM

### 2.1  Plastics

FDM is quick. FDM is cheap. FDM is "almighty".

Yes, for us plastic pollution is much more eye-catching. At the beginning of a discussion of FDM, Martha would address that using FDM technology surely means the consumption of plastic. 

But it doesn't mean FDM must exacerbate the environmental problems. Put it this way, know your enemy. Yes, if we want to stop plastics from destroying Mother Earth, we need to know better about it first. And people like [ecorpint](https://ecoprint.site/) are doing this. 


### 2.2  Utility of plastics

FDM fits the idea of Industry 4.0, which means highly customized/tailor-made products for everyone. Not fully, but at least partially. This means better utility of plastics and less waste and pollution. 

If you have an FDM printer at home or work, you can skip the searching, ordering (maybe lots of paperwork), and delivery costs to get what you want. 

Unfortunately, this is a dream at this stage (2024), since FDM machines are just becoming accessible to everyone. You may know that Creality opened up the market and Bamboo Lab made FDM ready for everyone. Cheaper than a smartphone, becoming one of the next must-have home appliances. However, not everyone can do the design as easily as possible. 

See, that's why Martha believes initiating relay is meaningful. 

### 2.3  All in plastics?

No. Not in relay. 

There are people enjoying fully printed designs. No metal parts, no other materials, purely printed in plastic designs. There are many excellent designs in that way. It's just Martha doesn't do that. 

She believes the best way to make a functional or artful design is to use every possible kind of material. Plastics have their own unique and universal advantages compared to metal, wood, etc. However, plastics are not truly almighty. 

The using of heat inserts in VORON2.4 is very impressive. 

When it is so handy to put metals into your design to make it work like a charm, why not. Not only heat insert, bearing, shaft, sheet material, etc. are all great. 


### 2.4  Using of support in FDM

Martha follows VORON's ethos. Design it without support or only several lines as support. The design of Steathburner demonstrates this pretty well.

According to her short experiences of FDM-oriented CAD, most of time, supports can be easily avoided. 

Yeah, save filament and be more environmentally friendly. 

By the way, depending on the STL to be printed, sometimes skirts were set to zero by Martha. Yes, Martha is a poor inside and hates waste of any kind (thus causing OC features and GAD). 






## 3  Core beliefs

### 3.1  Scavenge and recycle

Which is the most handy material should be the ones to put in use of your current case. 

There is no best choice, think about using everything around but not buying the ideal materials serving your purpose. 

Take this as our environmentally friendly gesture. 

Usually, this belief works. Even better than you think it could do. 


### 3.2  Waste at times

Time waits for no one. Don't hesitate on the CAD stage. FDM originated for fast prototyping. It still is. Just keep printing if you don't know how to design a thing after searching the Internet and asking around. 

Efficiency matters. 

And we relay, provides you the solutions and methods to minimize the waste of plastics. 

Wastes are inevitable daily. Accept it. Face it. Feeling guilty won't help. Our society needs huge amount of works to process the wastes in a proper manner better than landfilling every piece of waste in Hong Kong. 

Collect the wasted plastic and send it to relay workshop. We are also planning to recycle them. Way to go. 





## 4  The way to connection

relay provides services focusing on two things: 
* Experiences
* Positive recognition feedback

### 4.1  Experiences

We are living in a Society of the Spectacle (La Société du spectacle by Guy-Ernest Debord) with lots of Bullshit Jobs (狗屁工作, by David Graeber). 

When is the time you got your hands dirty and enjoyed the actual but not symbolized world? This is about STEAM. STEAM is not about opinions, but making real, feeling real. 

### 4.2  Positive recognition feedback

Experience only is not enough. If you fail in experiences, you get frustrated, and discouraged, and may reject STEAM more. 

We sincerely wish you succeed more in our relay operation.

### 4.3  Practice of getting both

For example, in our taster programme for the Earthquake Competition for high school students, we design the game rules carefully to make sure every participant can enjoy a certain degree of success, while the excellent minds can take the challenging part to exert more. 

This is based on the theory of comfort zone. You need to try the boundaries of your comfort zone, but you can't push too hard and fall too bad. Babe steps. Always staying in your comfort zone won't do you good since the world is turning so fast (i m sure you can see that). Challenging your zone boundary will make you nervous perhaps, but a certain degree of difficulty is exciting. We want to offer you that. If we are doing good, maybe you will experience flow.
