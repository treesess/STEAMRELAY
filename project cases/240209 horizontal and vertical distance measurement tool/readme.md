We'd say it's a "large range" measurement tool but it's bold to use "large" in such a casual manner. Anyway, for short, Martha made it a codename, PKM. 

The objective is to make a measurement tool for youth competition making paper tower cranes. Those two graphs below can give you an intuition about the specific requirements of this tool.

**Figure 1** Basic rules of paper tower crane competition and implied requirements for measurement tool to make sure this game is fair enough

Poor us, no budget again, so we started this by fumbling with recycled and unused materials in labs. We found a tripod with good enough quality but one part of the gimbal missing. We found a 1200 mm aluminum-extrusion-based ruler not sure what was it used for. We found 600 mm long steel rulers but not long enough to meet the requirement of measuring 1000 mm distance. Then seems like we can only do some stitches by reverse engineering using FDM parts.

**Figure 3** Easy levelling would be enough

**Figure 4** We love 608zz bearing and soft tape measure fits

And some protection at the end of the sharp edges of the extrusion. Good place to add a logo something.

**Figure 6** Then something uncommon appeared - M24 bolt with rounded head serving as plumb bob

I'm thinking that maybe laser would do better, but I've done this:

Well sometimes people do strange stuff. It's printing and see it tomorrow. 

Now you can imagine how it looks like a PKM in the eyes of a pseudo military fan girl who is still watching Lycoris Recoil.
