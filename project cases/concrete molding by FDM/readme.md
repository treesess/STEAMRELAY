it's not a new thing to print a mold then cast fresh concrete in to form a certain shape, such as a planter pot commonly seen. 

but what if we want very detailed with complicated geometry data which the traditional molding way won't work?

for example, a VORON cube:

the first concrete VORON cube (cvc) was cast here on 1 Jan 2025. it's far from perfection but it looks promising.

to be simple, it's melting down the thin mold printed by FDM and revealing the harden concrete.

w/c ratio, fine aggregate, additions, lubricant, many things could help with the final quality. 

by this way, there will be NO PARTING LINES. there could be more freedom of design. and it's quick. 

of course there are difficulties. like the bubbles inside, and layer lines as the feature of FDM (but hey, i personally like the layer lines!). and worst of all, fragile parts peeling off when taking off the mold. 

anyway, it's super fun. very excited doing the first demold.
