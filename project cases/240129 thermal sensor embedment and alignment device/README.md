In a research project, we need to embed thermal couple (NTC) into the fresh concrete and make sure it is in the center of the standard 100 mm concrete cube. 

Since casing fresh concrete involves vibration to de-bubble, simply placing the sensor inside the fresh concrete cannot garantee the probe's position. Thus a device for precise alignment was designed.

**Figure 1** Fix the NTC sensor wire at the bottom with tailor-made ABS printed base then using fish wire to keep the probe in tension so that the position will be surely in the very center of the cube
