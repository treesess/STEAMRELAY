Okay we don't have much budget. Martha wanted pegboards for tool organization very much. Not that expensive, but not the cheapest choice. 

She considered many options, including the [Honeycomb storage wall](https://link-url-here.org). She actually tried... but that is a real lot of printing and the installation is not that satisfactory which potential risk of snapping down. 

She also has some experience using wall grid panels previously. From the perspective of providing enough stiffness with the least metal, the grid, is the best choice, with very good modularity. So, yes, grid it is. 

Then it is about how to get proper hangers on the grid.

Yes, there are more like below:

Well, picking up from the massive off-the-shelf is painful, to be honest. And doesn't look consistent on one grid. 

Then came the idea of a universal hanger as a base (just similar to the Honeycomb one) and extension parts fixed to those hanger bases.

If you look carefully, you will find that Martha didn't intentionally design this look like a heart shape. On the contrary, Martha considered figuring out the best shape to provide the most fitness and stiffness with the least filament consumption.

The two holes are not necessary. They are for 3x4x5 heat inserts. In practice, only one hole is pretty much enough. Using heat inserts and M3 screws, the connection can be very tailor-made without worrying about connection strength. 

And see, simply screwing a long M3 screw, it can work as the most basic hanger to hang tools. 

There were already several applications based on this style. Will upload after sorting them up. 

Martha loves the cooperation and compensation between metal and plastic. As always.
