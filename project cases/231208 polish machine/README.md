based on Klipper to drive 4260 stepping motors to roll a barrel with sand and polish the objects inside the barrel. 

Used unused or recycled materials: 

1) wood plate from unused furniture pile;
2) recycled 5 mm thick glass barrel dismantled from wasted lab apparatus; 
3) recycled 5 mm thick PMMA plates. 


240129 This project is still on hold since we lack of knowledge of the grinding medium thus unable to get an expected polishing result yet.

While some of the part designs are worth sharing. For example, the support design which stands the major vertical loading of the rolling barrel.

**Figure 6** Mechanical part finished and running well


Also to make the installation easier, simple tools for alignment were printed and worked very well.
