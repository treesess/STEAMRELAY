## 1  Introduction 

Versatile and resourceful tech support for educational STEAM purposes as well as practical ones. To envision what can we do with FDM 3D printing in our daily work and life. 

Service provided by Technician Martha from DCEE labs.

The latest intro film [here](https://vtcstaff-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/shaun_shi_vtc_edu_hk/ERW8Dpqv68RHpxg3y_vByHABnx0XIehg0McMp_B-Udzasw?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=6xPsN0&referrer=Outlook.Web&referrerScenario=email-linkwithembed) (staff access only, sorry).

### 1.1 FDM works

Martha started with some traditional lightweight woodworking and metalworking as she wanted to be able to manufacture and make ideas real. After she tried her first 3D printer, she fully concentrated on FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) since this handy CNC is low-cost and accessible to everyone. 

Heating the plastic and your imagination is the limit (but hey, FDM is one kind of 3D printing tech of one kind of manufacturing approach, so have a sense of reality and be sure that you know FDM can't literally print everything). In our recognition, this fits the purpose of STEAM so well. 

- We used a 3D printing pen to draw cute ornaments:

- We used TPU flexible material to print smartphone case (proven quite durable):

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9364084f-de8d-4397-935c-271c468587a1)


- We used FDM to make our favorite doll ([Model by JIMMY_IW](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/ghost-in-the-shell-tachikoma)):

- We printed intriguing artistic "tensegrity" structures ([Model by ALECS_FORM](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/tensegrity-arc)):

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/1c3cf493-99cb-4cb9-b429-65237e833994)

- We printed an interesting grid shell structure ([Model by ALECS_FORM](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/architecture/hypar-gridshell)):

- We printed joyful toys from the Internet and played with them like a kid:

- Made kind of light art ([Model by lackaffchen](https://makerworld.com/en/models/633291)):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb9b088a-b60b-47de-ad49-721cb84b7e62)


- We made quick tools for alignment and made the installation work much faster and more precise:

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/ae827adb-d76b-4828-964d-93147e73373f)


- We used FDM to make functional stuff:

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/70ea9451-08e2-4059-8176-a4c518cd393c)

- We designed precision tools based on FDM:

- We used one printer to keep making another printer (the print in the photo below is [VORON Toolhead Stealth Burner](https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner)): 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/b7cb613a-3498-47b1-ad54-b8c04fdd7dac)


- We designed and made a highly customized adaptor to enable red dot sight on camera:

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/fe26c84c-95ec-466e-a6d3-28191f3a6670)

 

- And made our own logo and cards:

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/c014cb63-e4c3-4bf1-beca-bf39230776e4)



- And designed and made a low-cost shake table! (see project [vShaker](https://github.com/treesess/vShaker), by Martha ft. Ronald Lee. Based on [Klipper firmware](https://www.klipper3d.org/), one part from [VORONDESIGN](https://vorondesign.com/))

- And even an extended one for holding taster programmes for students to learn while playing with the earthquake simulation. Six groups of students shaking together!

FDM enlightened our lives and realized many of our small dreams. This feeling is so soooo STEAM. 


Sometimes, we just simply enjoyed seeing it printing and/or printed. 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/11963297-f1d9-4582-a5b8-e271faf7bad9)



All these made us decide to do something to get more people around me to see how could FDM 3D printing make a difference in our lives today and, get your hands dirty, get STEAM. 

Again and again, my appreciation to the [VORON DESIGN Team](https://www.vorondesign.com/). Martha is still wearing my first Voron Cube print every day!

### 1.2 Craft and artwork

There are more than FDM that Martha would like to promote: 

- Dried flower

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/8a584bf0-fb8f-40ce-8324-bf2a936adab4)

- Insect collection

When talking about getting hands dirty, being close to nature is the same as STEAM. 

- Copperplate

And for the "A" in STEAM, Martha would be glad to introduce you to English Caligraphy (Copperplate) if you are interested: 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/8bef53f1-d28a-416c-8c90-7b25cbf9ae96)

Then perhaps make your dear friend a card:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c31111-b8ad-40f9-815b-38fdc92c674f)



- Origami

Something Martha wants from a kid. Tried on and off but still didn't get it. **Should we do it together?**

We have the materials (strictly square papers specific for origami). 













## 2  Plants and plant foto taking

### 2.1 Apocynaceae

Martha is obsessed with plants, especially the Apocynaceae family (夾竹桃科). At this stage, Hoya Carnosa is the thriving one in her place. 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/df4d2a09-e9ea-4b5a-9923-d5eff9f9ccd0)



When hoya bloomed, with its velvet petals, sweet nectar and scent, it could be a warm gift for your beloved.

They are around us in the city and blooming sweet. Adenium obesum, Allamanda cathartica, Allamanda schottii (黃嬋), Catharanthus roseus (長春花), Nerium oleander (夾竹桃), Plumeria rubra (雞蛋花), Star jasmine (絡石), Pinwheel flower (山馬茶/狗牙花), and so on. More or less, they may have enlightened your life now and then. 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/3c3a9477-fd75-46f8-b2e6-d80dbcebb4ea)


Of course, white oleander can't be missed. 






### 2.2 More plants and fotoing

Sorry that her enthusiasm for Apocynaceae may be bits of biased to you. There are also pretty many other fascinating plants. You can always find your way to take care of them in your unique way:

Indulge Martha for a bit of personal love, roots in water:

In case you want to have an image taken from your lovely plants, we can also offer high-quality camera and lens and photo-taking skills to help you keep the beautiful moment forever.

(Note that this photo has no post-process. Most of times we prefer a sense of raw)
