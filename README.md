## Introduction 

Versatile and resourceful tech support for educational STEAM purposes as well as practical ones. To envision what can we do with FDM 3D printing in our daily work and life. Service provided by Technician Martha and Technician Ronald.

i started with some traditional lightweight woodworking and metalworking as i want to be able to manufacture and make ideas real. After i bought my first Ender3V2, i was fully concentrated on FDM since this handy CNC  is such low-cost and accessible to everyone. Heating the plastic and your imagination is the limit. 

In my recognition, this fits the purpose of STEAM so well. 

- We can use 3D printing pen to draw cute ornaments:

- We can use FDM to make our favorite doll:

- We can print pretty designs from the community and play around like a kid:

- We can use FDM to make functional stuff :

- We can design precision tools based on FDM:

- We can use one printer to keep making another printer (VORON PIF, Print It Forward)

- And make a logo and card:

FDM enlightened my life and realized many of my small dreams. This feeling is so soooo STEAM.

And there are more than FDM that i would like to promote: 

- Dried flower:

- Insect collection:

When talking about getting hands dirty, being close to nature is the same as STEAM. 

And for the A in STEAM, i'd be glad to introduce you to English Caligraphy (Copperplate) if you are interested:

Then perhaps make your dear friend a card:

All these made me decide to do something to get more people around me to see how could FDM 3D printing make a difference in our lives today and, get your hands dirty, get STEAM. 

At last, my appreciation to the [VORON DESIGN Team](https://www.vorondesign.com/). I am still wearing my first Voron Cube print every day!
