## Introduction 

Versatile and resourceful tech support for educational STEAM purposes as well as practical ones. To envision what can we do with FDM 3D printing in our daily work and life. Service provided by Technician Martha and Technician Ronald.

i started with some traditional lightweight woodworking and metalworking as i want to be able to manufacture and make ideas real. After i bought my first Ender3V2, i was fully concentrated on FDM since this handy CNC  is such low-cost and accessible to everyone. Heating the plastic and your imagination is the limit. 

In my recognition, this fits the purpose of STEAM so well. 

- We can use 3D printing pen to draw cute ornaments:

- We can use FDM to make our favorite doll:

- We can print elegant reindeer for Christmas:

- Also other Christmas ornaments:

- We can print playful toys from the Internet and play with them like a kid:

- We can make quick tools for alignment and make the installation work much faster and more precise:

- We can use FDM to make functional stuff :

- We can design precision tools based on FDM:

- We can use one printer to keep making another printer (VORON PIF, Print It Forward)

- And make a logo and card:

- And make a low-cost shake table! (see project vShaker, ft. Ronald Lee)

FDM enlightened our life and realized many of our small dreams. This feeling is so soooo STEAM. 


Sometimes, we just simply enjoy seeing it printing and/or printed.

And there are more than FDM that i would like to promote: 

- Dried flower:

- Insect collection:

When talking about getting hands dirty, being close to nature is the same as STEAM. 

And for the A in STEAM, i'd be glad to introduce you to English Caligraphy (Copperplate) if you are interested:

Then perhaps make your dear friend a card:

All these made me decide to do something to get more people around me to see how could FDM 3D printing make a difference in our lives today and, get your hands dirty, get STEAM. 

At last, my appreciation to the [VORON DESIGN Team](https://www.vorondesign.com/). I am still wearing my first Voron Cube print every day!

### Plants

Martha is obsessed with the Apocynaceae family (å¤¾ç«¹æ¡ƒç§‘). At this stage hoya carnosa is the thriving one in her place.

They are around us in the city and blooming sweet. Adenium obesum, Allamanda cathartica, Allamanda schottii (é»ƒå¬‹)ï¼Œ Catharanthus roseus (é•·æ˜¥èŠ±), Nerium oleander (å¤¾ç«¹æ¡ƒ), Plumeria rubra (é›žè›‹èŠ±), Star jasmine (çµ¡çŸ³), Pinwheel flower (å±±é¦¬èŒ¶/ç‹—ç‰™èŠ±), and so on. More or less, they may have enlightened your life now and then. 

There are also pretty many fascinating plants. Sometimes, with an FDM printed vase, we can make something a bit new.

Ferns, names she still doesn't know.
