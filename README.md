## 1  Introduction 

Versatile and resourceful tech support for educational STEAM purposes as well as practical ones. To envision what can we do with FDM 3D printing in our daily work and life. Service provided by Technician Martha and Technician Ronald.


### 1.1 FDM/CNC works

Martha started with some traditional lightweight woodworking and metalworking as she wanted to be able to manufacture and make ideas real. After she bought her first 3D printer, she was fully concentrated on FDM since this handy CNC is such low-cost and accessible to everyone. Heating the plastic and your imagination is the limit. 

In our recognition, this fits the purpose of STEAM so well. 

- We can use a 3D printing pen to draw cute ornaments:

- We can use FDM to make our favorite doll:

- We can print elegant reindeer for Christmas:

- Also other Christmas ornaments:

- We can print famous building miniatures:

- We can print an interesting structural demo:

- We can print playful toys from the Internet and play with them like a kid:

- We can make quick tools for alignment and make the installation work much faster and more precise:

- We can use FDM to make functional stuff :

- We can design precision tools based on FDM:

- We can use one printer to keep making another printer (VORON PIF, Print It Forward): 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/b7cb613a-3498-47b1-ad54-b8c04fdd7dac)


- And make a logo and cards:

- And make a low-cost shake table! (see project vShaker, ft. Ronald Lee)

- And even an extended one for holding taster programmes for students to learn while playing with the earthquake simulation. Six groups of students shake together!

FDM enlightened our lives and realized many of our small dreams. This feeling is so soooo STEAM. 


Sometimes, we just simply enjoy seeing it printing and/or printed.

Not only we are capable of FDM 3D printing, Technician Ronald also can provide powerful CNC to enlarge our manufacturing capacity. 

All these made me decide to do something to get more people around me to see how could FDM 3D printing make a difference in our lives today and, get your hands dirty, get STEAM. 

Again and again, my appreciation to the [VORON DESIGN Team](https://www.vorondesign.com/). Martha is still wearing my first Voron Cube print every day!

### 1.2 Craft and artwork

And there are more than FDM that Martha would like to promote: 

- Dried flower:

- Insect collection:

When talking about getting hands dirty, being close to nature is the same as STEAM. 

And for the "A" in STEAM, Martha would be glad to introduce you to English Caligraphy (Copperplate) if you are interested:

Then perhaps make your dear friend a card:

## 2  Plants and plant foto taking

### 2.1 Apocynaceae

Martha is obsessed with plants, especially the Apocynaceae family (å¤¾ç«¹æ¡ƒç§‘). At this stage, hoya carnosa is the thriving one in her place. 

![image](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/assets/20311124/df4d2a09-e9ea-4b5a-9923-d5eff9f9ccd0)

When hoya bloomed, with its velvet petals and sweet nectar, it could be a gift for your beloved.

They are around us in the city and blooming sweet. Adenium obesum, Allamanda cathartica, Allamanda schottii (é»ƒå¬‹), Catharanthus roseus (é•·æ˜¥èŠ±), Nerium oleander (å¤¾ç«¹æ¡ƒ), Plumeria rubra (é›žè›‹èŠ±), Star jasmine (çµ¡çŸ³), Pinwheel flower (å±±é¦¬èŒ¶/ç‹—ç‰™èŠ±), and so on. More or less, they may have enlightened your life now and then. 




### 2.2 More plants

Sorry that her enthusiasm for Apocynaceae may be bits of biased to you. There are also pretty many other fascinating plants. You can always find your way to take care of them in your unique way:

Sometimes, with an FDM-printed vase, we can make some new combinations:

In case you want to have an image taken from your lovely plants, we can also offer high-quality camera and lens and photo-taking skills to help you keep the beautiful moment forever.

(Note that this photo has no post-process, we prefer a sense of raw)
