As it is one-on-one service to you, the date and time, and even the duration of session are all flexible, adapting to YOUR needs. 

The main purpose is to convey the message that FDM is handy and you can use it every now and then every where without worries. FDM can surely bring you better efficiency, better work and life quality, and a lot of joys.
