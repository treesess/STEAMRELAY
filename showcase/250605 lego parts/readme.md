one student had a lego project needed to have some tailor made parts. 

for this task, the difficulties resided in the tolerance. the original lego parts were surely made from injection. this means even we had the lego official design parameters, we need to do very fine calibration to achieve "just right friction".

the hole was tested for 3 or 4 times to fine the mentioned "just right friction" before mass production.

also, since this part is tiny, 0.2 mm nozzle was used. 

later on, more similiar but different parts were needed and made.

the some kind of "crank" part needed to be assembled with different original lego parts, as well as itself. then things started to become more complicated.

Can you see that there are 3 different tolerances being verified in the picture below?
