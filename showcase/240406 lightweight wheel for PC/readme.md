Invented the wheel. i know it looks stupid to re-invent a wheel. So allow me to explain why i did this design: 

	a) i've got the need to move a PC in and out several times a month, to use the USB ports behind it (i use the front ports more often); 

	b) i didn't have a good fit wheel for this need. 

	c) i can buy it online but i don't like choosing products and online shops and the delivery lead time and the costs and the packing and... so on. 

 	d) i don't like crowded hardware shops either in SSP. 

	d) i just had the materials and experience to make one, easily.

	e) i thought i could sharpen my design skills by doing more drawings. 

	f) i enjoy DIY as always.

	g) i can go on explaining but kinda running out of alphabet. 


So here we go with this:

It was based on the previous 608zz bearing design for the [Polish Machine](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/tree/main/project%20cases/231208%20polish%20machine). 

So i only needed to draw a hex shaft and a mount on it, two parts only, printed quickly, then tape on my favorite cloth-based double-side tape, it just worked like a charm.

Made four of them and installed them without hesitation:

This is the PC they serve:

Happy printing and problem solved. They worked perfectly as expected. 

But i would still mention that the off-the-shelf product for this kind of need looks like this:

i did try this kind of the wheels for buckets etc. If you are lucky you may have a smooth experience, but if the quality of the product is not good, you may get annoyed when it starts screaming when you move it. 

One more thing, if you don't like 608zz, you can use the POM wheels which were pretty commonly seen on old 3d printers such as Ender 3 series:

i didn't use POM simply because i didn't have one at that time and had lots of 608zz.
