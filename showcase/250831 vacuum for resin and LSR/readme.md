in August 2025, epoxy resin and LSR (liquid silicon rubber) were tried a lot. handled. 

in the middle of trying resin and LSR, vacuum seemed needed for de-bubble of the fresh mixture. 

so this was made:

it worked of course. can choose to run 1~4 motors in parallel for different suction. 



it's just... well, i'd be quiet about why i m not using vacuum for resin and LSR right now (okay, it was bumping that traumitized me). 

hey, good results still came out without the vacuum.
