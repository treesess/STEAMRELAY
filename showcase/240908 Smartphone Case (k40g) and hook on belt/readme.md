Previously mentioned the case printed by TPU which has been used for month and still very durable but got kinda dirty. During the time of use, i tried different ways to make my phone more adaptive for my working scenarios. And now it's time to get the stable solution public.

First of all, a bit more intro to the TPU case. Durable and flexible are the biggest advantages. With the tailor-made ring hole as the interface to connect to other accessories.

Second, i found nothing feel safer than this steel woven ring.

Finally, it's the belt hook:

It is easy to mount the phone on the belt via the hook and also easy the same way around. Better than the other belt products, i think my way has the less swaying of the phone when hooked and provides the best of convenience of getting the phone when needed.
