Started from reading the [article by CNC Kitchen](https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/reduce-your-3d-printing-noise-with-a-concrete-paver) then found that some farmer actually did it:

That's lots of Bambu A1 and P1S sitting on concrete. Okay i m outdated for years on this upgrade. So get some. 

first, get the dimensions right and do a simple CAD simulation of the molding according to the recycled materials scavenged:

then cut the woods and assemble them up:

yes i tried to use a printed reference but turned out it's not needed at all since manual alignment was good enough already. 

note that all materials for making the molds were recycled and part of them were recycled again after demold.

the thing is, 50 mm thick concrete slab for fdm5 (VORON2.4 350 mm build) is about 30 kg mass. that's... heavy:

while the slab for fdm6 (VORON0.2) is much easy:

next day, demolded them. quality good enough:

the third one was cast after the demold of the first two because i needed to reuse one big wood plate in making the largest concrete slab. 

so, just took 2 to 3 days, they were made and started curing on the floor (too heavy i can't afford to make them cured in water tank. and they don't need to be that strong):

-------------------------

this case is kind of civil. and it featured the recycling belief of STEAM RELAY. 

you know, even the cement i used in this case was recycled from expired bags. i crashed the expired cement manually then sieved to fine grade. yes, it's feasible though the strength might be a bit compromised. but these are just food pad for FDM printers, they don't need to be very strong.
