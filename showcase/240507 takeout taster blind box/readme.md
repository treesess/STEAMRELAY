This is the most meaningful job i've done this year so far. 

We went to a high school bringing stuff for students. The purpose of this trip was to get high school students interested in engineering. A non-profit trip without propaganda but only showed the logo of our institute. 

A tenon puzzle and a catapult model were chosen to be the gifts for the students. They are expected to have fun assembling the tenon puzzle (榫卯梅花鎖) and the catapult.

Thank you the design community for sharing such amazing models! i love playing with those toys. And the students loved them too!

The tenon is actually difficult to assemble and I can't find a good assembly guide online, so i made one as attached. For the ease of recognition of the "key" part (which will be impossible to tell after full assembly), i used my DIY laser machine to burn a light mark of the logo of our institute on it. Of course, the author credit was printed on top of the assembly guide.

i think the quintessence is using origami to make the blind box packing with the Assembly Guide inside.
