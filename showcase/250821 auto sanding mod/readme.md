this was a mod for the fdm2 machine (a modified Ender3 pro) toolhead. 

this was used to position an object on the modified toolhead then used customized gcode to do repeating circular motion with a sandpaper fixed on the bed, in order to sand the object automatically. 

nice try, but the sanding result was not uniform enough. yet.
