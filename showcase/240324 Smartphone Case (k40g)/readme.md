Making your own smartphone case is not easy since there are lots of dimensions to measure and you may need to do it repeatedly. Agony. Still, i tried since i need it or i always can't find my phone. 

First off, find out the official data as possible:

Then all the left is labour...

After dozens of tries and errors, i made a usable one printed by TPU and used a soldering iron to do the finish-up. 

Yes, all i need is the ear with a hole so that i can hang it on one of the belts on my body. i chose TPU without doubt since i want my phone to be okay when dropped accidentally on the ground. 

All goals achieved. But i have to say it's terrible to DIY a smartphone case with CAD. Maybe it's just me not skillful enough to handle the tolerance issues.
