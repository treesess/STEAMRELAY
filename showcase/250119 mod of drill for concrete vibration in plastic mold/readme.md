There are ways for fresh concrete vibration which is crucial to making solid, quality concrete. 

With FDM printing, the potential of different shapes of molding can be achieved. Meanwhile, the vibration might be difficult due to the very customized shape of mold. 

Then i found this online:

He used a palm sander to do the vibration job. That's brilliant. 

i don't have a palm sander, but a hand drill can do the same by grasping any mass-eccentric object. 

Here comes the CAD of a connection between two bolts (an M8 and an M10 by my hand):

worked like a charm. difficulty solved.

i tried it on the recent molding of a small object, it was so pretty efficient that the excessive liquid leaked into the void infill eara of printed mold!
