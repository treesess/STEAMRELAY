material has its limit. the [previous version](https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/blob/main/showcase/231209%20hex%20desk%20joint/readme.md) failed recently:

no a suprise the failure happened in the weakness spot due to low z adhersion and bending moment. 

by reviewing the previous design, it has these disadvantages: 

1) too complicated for a simple function
2) applying nonflexible materials as the major stress-bearing part was not smart enough

recent months the application of flexible material like TPU has been discovered more and more. TPU fits this case.

very simple drawing would do. 

but the dimensions must be measured correctly to have the just-fit tension for this part. trial and error of course.

lucky me, fits well at the first trial. 

by using TPU as a 'spring' this connector is expected to be very durable.
