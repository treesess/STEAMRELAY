**The need:**

We have two nearby lab rooms serving concrete mixing and testing. Those two rooms have electronic card access controlled doors. 

When working, sometimes we need to go forth and back between two rooms frequently but we can't leave the doors wide open for a long time because we need to keep the cool in and one of the rooms needs temperature and humidity control (about concrete curing and also about machine machines inside). However, it was inconvenient to use the card access when we were handling fresh concrete and so on. 

Therefore, we need to leave a small gap to keep the door almost closed but not locked when working in such kind of scenarios. 

**The solution:**

Door stopper is the way to go. but the common door stopper is not good enough for this case since we need the gap to be as small as possible. We did have the commonly used door stoppers, but they also have a problem in that many times the floor is too slippery for them to stop the door from closing. 

Then the below kind of door stopper fits:

Printed by TPU, it is expected to be very durable even under the frequent impact from the heavy door closing motion.

And the gap can be fully controlled by CAD drawing.

We apply this design to both doors and they worked pretty well as expected. Convenient to kick them into position by foot, and convenient to open the door stopped by them by foot as well when our hands are holding stuff.

This design is another typical case showing the advantage of FDM. The drawing was so easy to be done in 5 minutes, and then went to the printer to print while doing other jobs. Problem solved within an hour.
