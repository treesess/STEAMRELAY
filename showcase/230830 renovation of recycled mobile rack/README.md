**Case cause:** An old permeability apparatus was to be wasted. It had a strong steel mobile rack as the base and a glass tank on it with heavy sand in the tank. Some time was used to take apart the apparatus and the mobile rack was decided to be recycled and reused. 

**Type:** Recycle

**Difficulty:** Middle. 

**Descriptions:** After tearing the apparatus apart, the main mobile rack looked like this:

The xy plane size is 1400x600 mm. 

It has a robust steel frame that can sustain heavy-duty loading but not enough shelves/plates to hold stuff on it. There were also issues with it, such as sharp protrusions which cause potential harm and difficulties when moving it. 

Firstly, the protrusions were made into handlers as shown below. The design is a very KISS (Keep It Simple n Stupid) one but turned out very handy when using.

And also the extruded stands were protected by TPU (flexible material) printed covers.

Secondly, spare wooden plates were found in the storage room and cut into exact sizes and shapes to make the shelves. Only the top and bottom were done since the plan is to make some tool carriers and filament storage in the middle. The plan also includes putting three VORON printers on the top layer.

After what s done, it is already capable of serving. Still, i wish to see its potential fully developed since i like scavenging and recycling.
