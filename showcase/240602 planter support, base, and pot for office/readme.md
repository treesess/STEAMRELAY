They are large. 

The plants (zz lucky plant, 雪鐵芋) in an office were once uncared and dying years ago. i repotted them with some unmature pot base design back then. Recently the office relocated so were the plants and those planter bases were mostly broke in pieces. And since there were still no gardeners took care of those plants, they were prostrated. 

So there are 3 parts of this side project:

1) Build up supports for the zz plants so that they can stand straight.
2) Redesign the base for the planters to hold them.
3) Print two shells for those naked pots.

## Part 1, Plant support

Did measurements first:

Then came up with some plans to serve as the supports:

For the best quality of FDM printing, hex profile was adopted:

it is a modular design so that we can extend the support as we need. 

And then print some hookers by TPU to link the branches to the support as well as other branches:

It worked well enough:

## Part 2, Large planter base

Since the planters are really too large (400 mm cylindrical-like ones), i print two parts as concrete mold then hot melt glued them together for concrete casting:
