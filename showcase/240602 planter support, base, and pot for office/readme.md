They are large. 

The plants (zz lucky plant, 雪鐵芋) in an office were once uncared and dying years ago. i repotted them with some unmature pot base design back then. Recently the office relocated so were the plants and those planter bases were mostly broken in pieces. And since there were still no gardeners took care of those plants, they were prostrated. 

So there are 3 parts of this side project:

1) Build up supports for the zz plants so that they can stand straight.
2) Redesign the base for the planters to hold them.
3) Print two shells for those naked pots.

## Part 1, Plant support

Did measurements first:

Then came up with some plans to serve as the supports:

For the best quality of FDM printing, hex profile was adopted:

it is a modular design so that we can extend the support as we need. 

And then print some hookers by TPU to link the branches to the support as well as other branches:

It worked well enough:

## Part 2, Large planter base

Since the planters are really too large (400 mm cylindrical-like ones), i printed two parts as concrete mold then hot melt glued them together for concrete casting:

The concrete bases are heavy, about 5 kg each. Mixed and Cast by recycled expired cement and some river sand. Very strong this time and will not easily get broken for sure. Looks good and is functional as a water holder to prevent water from leaking out when you flowering the zz plants.

## Part 3, Vase-like pots for small ones

There were other small pots of zz plants without decorative pots. To make them better looking and fit, i printed the largest pot so far...

The design was very simple. And fuzzy skin feature was adopted to make some texture and increase the stability of the structure a bit:

It looks good. With an independent "collar" part:

----

This side project was actually a bit challenging to me though it didn't look like a case with unique requirements. The actual challenge was i was never sure what was the best plan to solve the problems since i had failed once years ago. And i had no idea how to make it artistic enough up to STEAM RELAY's standard. 

Well, anyway, it's done so far, move on, girl.
