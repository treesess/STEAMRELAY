nothing too new in this case. just another plumber work. 

We found the original drain connection for the sediment tank was too high, which caused bent flexible tube and a low flow rate. Thus, we cut it down to a lower lever to straighten the flexible tube. Here a new connection was needed.

The flow rate got its max after our work. no more flooding issue for the tanks.
