suitable for the de-bubbling of gypsum mixture. function similar to the dentist's. perhaps also good for resin and LSR mixture debubbling.

major print parts include the upper plate with heat inserts for mounting vibration motors, and the lower part for mounting the electronics (i.e., a PWM module with rotary switch knob).

some M3 screws for fastening. 4 springs as major stiffness provider. 4 TPU printed foot pads for softening the impact on your desktop.

this simple design works. but there is an issue that it's lightweight but too strong on vibration (2 motors doing vertical vib and one motor doing horizontal vib). this makes it a walker if you don't hold it down. 

thus if there is something more to add on, it's surplus weight. maybe casting a concrete plate is a good idea! will do later.
