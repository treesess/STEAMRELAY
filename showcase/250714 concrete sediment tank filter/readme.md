Sad that our so-called "tailor made" concrete waster water sediment tank wasn't made just like what we ordered provided by the contractor. 

The problem was when the flow rate is too large, large particles go straght to the drain without being sedimented. So now we need some addons to stop the particles.

This is when it's done:

The trick is how we made the dense sieve. in CAD it's just a solid plate:

But we can adjust the slicing parameter to turn it into a sieve plate:

Here are the parameters for your info:

In the end we made two, the later one is denser:
