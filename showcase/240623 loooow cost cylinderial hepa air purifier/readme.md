The major purpose of this case is to DIY a HEPA air purifier for the lab at the lowest cost as i can. 

The total cost (fan and 12 V ACDC PSU exclusive) for one of these purifiers was within HKD20. The fan was just recycled therefore cost nothing. The 12 V ACDC PSU was recycled from old PC therefore cost nothing as well. Need just a few grams of PETG filament to print all parts and hot melt glue sticks to assemble the prints with the HEPA filter. 

Optionally, i added DIY activated carbon packs since i will need to print ABS without ventilation later.

the first workable version made:

During the make, i found it inconvinient to glue the HEPA filter to the upper and lower mount, so an alignment cylindrial tool was made by using vase mode printing:

Much easier to do the second one.

Both work fine.
