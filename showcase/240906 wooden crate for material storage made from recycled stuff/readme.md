need some crates for massive storage of concrete raw materials. the wasted wooden plates were taken out, measured, modelled, then assembled with some printed parts.

in this case, even the self-tapping screws were recycled ones that i collected one or two years ago from wastes. 

printed plastic parts helped with two aspects greatly: 

- alignment. with the printed parts, the alignment of wooden plates was pretty easily done.
- increasing the strength. the printed parts enabled using longer screws and performed as screw nuts on one side, therefore the strength was largely increased.

look nice. 

for the lower part, steel angles were used.
