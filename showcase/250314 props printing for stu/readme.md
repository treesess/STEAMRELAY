Student requester found me for the printing of props from a TV play. Assuming he likes the play a lot. 

It's a sword-ish model. The student thought it might be too long to print in one piece so he cut it into 3 parts. but our fdm5 VORON2.4 is a 350x350 mm build workhorse. no problem for diag length of 490 mm printing.

It took about 15 hrs or so to get it printed. to get the best print quality and strength (as requested), the model was carefully rotated to make sure the "z weak" was minimized. 6 wall loops (i.e., 2.4 mm) applied to make it very strong.
