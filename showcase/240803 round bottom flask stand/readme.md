Flask holders are typically needed in chemical labs, food labs etc. 

there are products to buy and many netizens uploaded their own 3D designs for FDM printing. 

in this case, we did our own drawing because: 

- it's pretty easy, and 
- we specifically want more stability in this case, so i extended the height of the holder. and 
- using the spiral mode design and slicing method in this case used far less plastic and made it very fast for printing.
