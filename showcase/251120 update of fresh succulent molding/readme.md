the previous method can be found there:

https://github.com/treesess/STEAMRELAY/tree/main/showcase/251020%20molding%20for%20fresh%20succulent

and i found myself stupid to have to turn it over for the debubble of the upper side. so the current method is much straightforward. 

first prepare the plants:

then cast the well-mixed LSR (liquid silicone rubber) in:

well this might be too simplified but sorry that i don't have more photos for deeper description of the steps.

(note that the sharp tips still failed. the bubbles appearred during the curing and i find no way to get them out, so far (251227)).

as long as the tips were not preeetty sharp, we can manage.
