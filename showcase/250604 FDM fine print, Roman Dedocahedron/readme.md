though STEAM RELAY prefers using FDM to produce functional/structural stuff mainly, but obviously people like fine thing (which is more suitable for light curing printing, which we don't provide). 

however, FDM is somehow able to do fine print to a degree.

this is a decorative replica of ancient relic called Roman Dedocahedron, may have some practical use but still under discovering. Student wanted to study on this so we printed one. 

The printing took a day of machine time. though still not as fine as uv curing prints, but kinda comparable. 

-------

the study of using FDM for fine print is still ongoing in STEAM RELAY and substantial skills were learned, to provide finer prints in the future.
