Another VORON 0 was built since we were planning to do much more on 0.2/0.25 mm nozzle (the printing time would be crazily increased therefore more printers were wanted for sure).

personally i really wanted this one to be kinda perfect since the previous DIY FDM printers were not close to perfection. and yes i made it. and applied Serial Request on Reddit /r/voroncorexy/. the serial number is v0.4228 if you're interested. 

there were mods of braces to enhance the frame stiffness, mods covering up z screw upper area, mods for COB LED light strips (the most painful one!), and a decorative flower on LDO extruder. 

of course i'd share all mods if anyone wants them. it's just... after that labor of love revision of those parts over and again, i was quite exhausted and didn't want to open that messy CAD file for some time... just ask me if you want the file and i will be encouraged to sort out the CAD and STL for you.

and it was noisy when four printers were all printing - the fans, were bxxxxdy turning.
