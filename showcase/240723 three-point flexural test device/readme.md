This was made for the [ejection infill tests](https://youtu.be/nt1GokmUJrU?si=ipc6NAOVJ45_BqrQ). 

in the beginning, i just wanted to rush these tests through and made it too simple:

But test results showed me that i needed to be more standardized and precision. 

so there it went:

(pls ignore the linear rails on both sides, i was simply lazy to uninstall them.)

i went on the tests with this device.

the results were surely looking better. and i can say this is one of the most low-cost three-point test device plans you can find.

about the ejection infill method for fdm, umm, i've done all the tests for Episode 03, but still procrastinating on how to present the test results. The reason is that, i found seam position affects the bending strength of specimen greatly, and it is a difficult variable to control, which made my test results not easy to explain. 

wish me good luck.
