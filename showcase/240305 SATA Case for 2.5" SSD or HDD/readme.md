First off, find the dimensions online (don't measure it yourself since this is highly standardized).

Then draw the case.

The purpose of this design is to match the SATA to USB adaptor purchased online so that i can take the SSD easily. 

But later on i simply cancelled out all the screws and buried the SSD into the TPU print fully.

Yes, and i used hot melt glue to fill the gap and fix the adaptor to the SATA port. 

During the use of several months, i was satisfied with this make without worrying about dropping/kicking it accidentally with the thick TPU protection or loosening of the adaptor.
