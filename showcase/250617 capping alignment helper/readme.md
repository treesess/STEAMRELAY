in the lab we have this kind of concrete cylinder capping device. It can work but the user reported that it's not easy to do the alignment but the operation window is small (only seconds before the sulfur compound turns back to solid after pouring down to the device).

so the white chunk of alignment helper as accessories were printed. 

the user spoke highly of the alignment helper. 

Note that those chunks look like just simple cylinders with holes, but actually carefully calibrated to make sure the diameters are the excact same with the steel ones. To garantee the accuracy of the capping device.
