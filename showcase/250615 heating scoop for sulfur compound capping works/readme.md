The research team needed heating tools to melt sulfur compound to do the capping works on the coring concrete specimens. 

The temperature control was not easy. The compound needed to be heated up and maintain temperature in the range of 115 to 150 degrees. Too low, the sulfur won't melt. Too high, the sulfur can't be used. Also, heating up sulfur is toxic therefore good ventilation is required, but winds takes heat away very fast, which make the control of temperature harder. 

And it was needed urgently. STEAM RELAY was found to deal with it after the team tried for half a day but failed. Sad that we really didn't have a proper tool to get this heated up. 

So a quick DIY solution was made.

This heating scoop modified the scoop they used by adding a heater unit (recycled from an old FDM printer) at the bottom, then added a layer of silicone heat insulation (A B mixture). 

Aluminium foils were used to conduct the heat quicker and more uniformly since the original scoop was made of stainless steel (not a good heat conductor). 

It worked. With the PID temperature control, the wanted temperature was acquired. Successful concrete cylinder capping was done soon. 

but it had some problems. as made in urgent, it was using an old FDM board to control (Marlin firmare). Due to not enough power out, the firmware kept reporting heating errors then needed to restart the firmare. The second problem originated the same board, that, the power rate was too low it took a long time.
