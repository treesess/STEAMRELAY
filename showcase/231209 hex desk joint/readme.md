Building room 1014 to be a proper workshop from ground, i found two half-hex desks to serve as a table in the centre of the room for general working and talking. i need them to be joined into one full hex desk but not separated. 

Then a quick drawing was done based on the structure of the desks:

There were holes on the beams of the desks, so i used those holes:

Strong and durable while having no affect to the look of the desk. No problem in the past 6 months and not likely to have any problem in the future.
