Since the requestor appreciated the previous stand, she wanted more stands for the human models. 

This time came the human chest model. To have a consistent design style (though i actually didn't think of any style when doing the stand for the head...), the same base shape was adopted for the chest one.

The chest model is larger and heavier than the head one. The requirement of displaying both the front and back sides of the model made it more difficult to do this stand. 

i tried this hex stem way to make sure the blockage of view is minimal, then hanged the whole model up since the irregular shape of the model makes it hard to support from the bottom. To make the around 300 mm tall stand more stable with the ability to rotate 360 degrees for easy viewing, two 608zz bearings were put in the base.

The curve of the hex stem was well adjusted to bend over so that the center of gravity of the model was almost aligned with the axis of the lower part of the stand (as well as the axis of the bearings). 

After one time of try n error, the second print was good enough:

More views when rotating freely:

That's it.
