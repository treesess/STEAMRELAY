it was a long time (2.2 days).

but with some problems: 

1) Walls/perimeters and columns too thin (come on, **it was less than 0.4 mm**):

Walls too thin also caused unstable bridging nearby or bridging failures. 

2) Cantilever overhangs:

Almost all the corners of this model has cantilever overhangs which cannot be printed without support. But it is impractical to manually add supports to the huge amount of cantilever overhangs. 


3) The inside details are not visible after printing since they are hidden by the outside walls. This means the filament and machine time spent on printing the inside parts were all wasted.

It's not all about the CAD problem, some defects could be avoid if it was PLA. And with a lower print speed. Maybe. 


---------------------

Not that these defects were not anticipated, but sometimes it requires the full print out to convince people. Is there anyway to do better on the CAM side or hardware side? Yes, like using 0.2 mm nozzle, but the cost won't be balanced. 

to be honest, for such a large creature, i'd like to say no to any models with walls thinner than 0.8 mm and columns less than 2 mm diameter.

this pisa tower is also tall and complicated with many thin columns (about 3 mm diameter), but totally good for printing.
