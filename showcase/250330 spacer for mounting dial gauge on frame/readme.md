on the apparatus used in a lab session, a dial gauge was supposed to be mounted firmly on the frame.

but this one wasn't because of the gap too large between the mount and the frame:

use some paper to filling the gap would do the workaround, but it'd be troublesome when the dial gauge needs to be moved around. 

so a simple TPU spacer was drawn and printed in 20 mins and problem solved.
