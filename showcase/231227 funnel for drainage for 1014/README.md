The major workshop of STEAM RELAY is located in storage room 1014 which was a storage room without any water supplier or any drainage system. 

However, working and enjoying DIY involves water usage, as well as mopping and other cleaning routines, and so is the water generated from the dehumidifier. 

The nearest drain point is on the corridor floor. 

Of course Martha tried to pour water directly into the hole covered by a grid filter in the beginning. The results have been terrible as shown below.

No matter how slow and careful you try, the water will splash everywhere in this way. 

Funnel is the very natural idea to fix this. Therefore came the quick practical drawing.

**Figure 3**  This design used a trick of bridging to reduced printing difficulty when slicing the entity

**Figure 4**  Since this design was quick, fuzzy skin option was checked to enhance the stiffness of the print

In use, we found that the funnel was too small and not tall enough thus water still spilled out when pouring too fast. 

So the below extension part was designed.

**Figure 5**  Extension of funnel

of course printing a new higher funnel would be the best choice, but that will waste time and material. We preferred not to.

**Figure 6**  Cross-section view of joint of original funnel and its extension part

The extension part will simply be inserted into the original funnel. 

Then let us see how it worked.

**Figure 7**  Pouring test with funnel extension

Well, the joint didn't work as solid as expected when pouring hard. But generally speaking the goal has been achieved. 

I'd say this whole thing happened so fast as a by-project. Totally worth doing and avoided the daily suffering of pouring waste water (yes i mopped the floor frequently).
