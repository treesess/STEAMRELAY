(Model from Internet)

But... this is not the end of story. The request extended to a full set of body armor. 

both VORONs were on, crazily printed forward for a week (with several failures because of all kinds of situations), used up all my white PETG filament (colorful white filaments) and finally got it done... 

-------

the difficult is not the parts are all large. It is the rotation of model to get better print quality and how to add support to get it printed stably that agonised. 

i m happy that the student is satisfied.
