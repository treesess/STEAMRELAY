it took 2+ days to make this thing. from learning Meshmixer and f3d to fix OBJ or rebuild the model, to planning the sections and assembly, slicing and printing, and finally gluing up. 

thus, our service can provide services extended to repair/fixing of obj models to printable ones. 

yes, it's a disaster to make a model designed for CG into a watertight printable one. 

but the result is kind of worthy. the details are good. print quality is high.
