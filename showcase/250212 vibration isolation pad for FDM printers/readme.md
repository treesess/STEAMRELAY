previously we used thick concrete slabs under the printers to get them some stability. It is hard, stiff, while there is still one other part to absorb the vibration energy to get better stability for the printers. 

here is a simple quick solution: printing of a block with different infill percentage by soft material TPU, to achieve vibration absorption at different frequencies. 

in the slicer software, using the cut to parts tool to get the block layered.

then set the infill density of different  layers to different percentages.

I cut the block into 5 layer groups and set the infill from 10% to 50%.

placing them under the four corners of the concrete slab, it's done.

The result was pretty amazing. now the two big VORON printers are as stable as Mount. Tai when printing. 


Of course, you can buy professional products off the shelf. Might be a bit expensive. Simply using bubble foam can also get a not-bad result. But of course, the professional products aren't expensive for nothing.
