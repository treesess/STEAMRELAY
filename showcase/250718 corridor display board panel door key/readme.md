The display boards on the corridor wall are of old age. 

the boards' panel door requires special triangle shape key to open if you want to renew the display content. 

In lab we have almost all screw tips to figure this out. But it is possible we print a key for the admin team so that they can access the display board content whenever they want without calling us? 

let's see:

it's easy to CAD a key out.

took 5 mins to print out. 

But, oh, but.

due to heavy rust of the old door, the plastic key has not enough stiffness to drive the latch open.

so twisted. Yes it's petg, ductile but soft. 

okay we give up. try metal screw bit if you need to. we lost to the rust. sad.
