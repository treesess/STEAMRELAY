fairly simple printing after resizing the model to 200 mm height with 130 mm dia. original model: https://makerworld.com/en/models/644147-plant-pot-smooth-ribs-curved by HpInvent at mw. 

(i won't tell you that the slicer updates gave this model a deadly flaw which made me reprinted it 3 times...)

the final print looked nice.
