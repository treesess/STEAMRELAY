One machine needs to be connected to air pipes and those pipes need to dock with a filter. Due to the pressure in the air pipes when running the machine, it was easy to get loosened even with strip ties then caused the loss of connection.

To fix this, the first option should be to use the off-the-shelf hose clamp like this:

But new problems were: 

1) This type of clamp was designed to work on water hoses which are much stronger to be tightened by the metal parts of the clamp. When using hose clamp on this small air pipe, abrasion happened as shown in the photo below.
2) These hose clamps were oversized and the quantity wasn't enough.

So we provide a simple plastic plan here:

It's a single-part drawing with easy geometry:

Then a bit of chamfer to finish up:

Check out the distance for the choosing of the screw. i'd say M3x12 or M3x 16 in stock of our workshop should be fine:

35 mins for 4 pcs. using PETG full infill to ensure strength and durability:

Basically cost nothing~

Finally, install them on:

Perfect fit, airtight.
