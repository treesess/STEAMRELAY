for the turbo engine model (https://makerworld.com/en/models/1291184-motorized-turboprop-engine-model#profileId-1321498) printed for the teaching purpose demo, we don't have the pcb from the designer but we have some PWM modules. 

therefore for the fast done of this one, a housing was designed and printed to encapsule the modules for the speed control of the two parts of the model by N20 drives.
