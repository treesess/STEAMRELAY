Better buy a mature product i suggested. 

but after some discussions and searching for the right product, they decided to have me make a better DIY one.

well, not very difficult but this is a bit wired. well, this is wired but it worked well. 

i called it "mushroom".

this time, they wanted a larger scoop. more silicone was used to thicken the insulation. and a big hollow cap was printed for better heat insulation. 

still using FDM firmware but Klipper for this one. Higher power output for sure.

as a result from the thermal imaging, i think the insulation design is not bad.

and we have Klipperscreen on... a quick casing for the electronic compartment.

see, i even added the cooling fan for the EC... well, still, this casing is a bit too thin.

anyway... it's well done. 



---------------

btw, the proper product (melting pot) looks like this below (or much larger). well, yes it's a bit too large for our lab/project.
