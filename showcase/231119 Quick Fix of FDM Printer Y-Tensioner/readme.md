The Ender3 S1 Pro Y tensioner broke. Not sure why, but i had both ends of the Y axis broken during the use of a year or so. Perhaps it was caused by the belt tension being too high. 

This is just a quick fix to make the machine running again as soon as possible. Therefore only the most necessary solid was designed to be printed, including: 

- Two M5 holes for installation of two M4 screws to mount the tensioner frame on 4020 al extrusion.
- One hole for the tensioner adjustment screw.
- One frame to provide stiffness for the above.

i forgot the rotational matter (of the pulley part) but it didn't matter at all.

Installed in no time.

Looking good but the pulley part did have the freedom to rotate. And the overall stiffness of this part was not quite enough. 

This is how it looked when i rotated it manually (but in actual printing, it won't happen):

Below is the comparison between the original but broken part (left) and the print of quick fix (right):

With this quick fix in 30 minutes including printing time, the machine can keep running for a decent time.

Later on, the board of this machine was down and i replaced it with a laser board and modified it to a laser machine. Seems the precision is still good til now with this quick fix.
