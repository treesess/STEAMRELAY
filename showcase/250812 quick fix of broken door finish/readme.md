a very practical need here. the door was too old and peeling off skin.

by printing such a clamp the problem was solved.

you know, a) it was surely not a good idea to rip it all off, b) it hurt! seriously! c) we would be moving out of here in one or two years, no need to change the door. 

so, as far as i considered, this was the best we can do about it.
