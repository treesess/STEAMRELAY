This is a total manual skill recently obtained. 

It's been a wide concern among FDM players and makers how to fuse two segments of filament together so that the filament can be fully used for printing. There are free plans and tools designed, but the success rate is not so satisfactory as i tried. There are also very expensive off-the-shelf products for this purpose, which i definitely prefer not to buy. 

simply by your hands and a bit of heat, you can do it nice and neat in a minute. just some practice paid.

First melt one or both end of the filament, then hold tight while pushing them together aligned, before cooling down. Hold steadily til the knot cools down, and it's well fused.

knife the knot to about 1.75 mm dia. done.

more than saving filament, fusion TPU can achieve a loop for many applications, such as a flexible ring hanging stuff (e.g., my phone, key, etc.)

TPU is a bit harder to fusion, but with a bit more patience, you can do it. The fused one has at least 90% of the tensile strength and the ability to stretch. 

Before learning how to fuse TPU together, i used such a small device as below for the connection:
