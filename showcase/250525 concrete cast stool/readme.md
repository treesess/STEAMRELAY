it was a fun experience making it. 

because the printed mold is only one time use (unable to reuse due to the geometry restraint), i tried to print the mold thin and weak. 

i used some tape as reinforcement so that the plastic mold held itself after heavy concrete was poured in. 

it was like, um, jelly. interesting and unexpectly funny.
