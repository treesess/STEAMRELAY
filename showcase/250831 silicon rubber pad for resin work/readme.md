used FDM to print the mold for LSR (liquid silicon rubber) then got the SSR (solid silicon rubber) pad for resin works on thin dried flowers.

if without the SSR pad, believe me, the success rate would be much lower if you want to do both side. 

with the SSR pad, even when resin accidentally leaked out, it was easy to manage and recover a good state of wanted resin on the flower surfaces. 

and, resin never sticks to SSR, so pretty easy to clean up. protect your desk from being ruined by resin works. 

i searched around and asked LLM, seemed like no one tried this before. but it was pretty interesting, wasn't it?
