after vcp (vibration cementitious printing) achieved relatively good flowrate control, it is time to update the motion system from i3 gantry to a VORON2.4 fix bed, in order to isolate the vibration of the nozzle and frame from the bed on which the printed part sits. 

it is not just switching toolhead and x carriage of a standard VORON2.4 since a fix bed is still not good enough for vibration isolation. a separate bed, or say, an independent bed, is wanted. 

to achieve a separate bed, the original electronic compartment of VORON2.4 needs to be moved to somewhere else (i chose the rear of the printer), and more covers are needed to prevent cementitious materials from splashing out on the printer, which would be difficult to clean up. 

so, there will be mods serving the said purposes. and this folder is currently for the placement of the mods before further documentations. 

1) DIN rail mount to 2020 extrusions at rear.stl

for mounting the DIN rails at the rear of the printer. use two M3x8 shcs screws and T nuts to fix it to the back columns, take the DIN rail through and use one M5x16 and T nut to further lock up the rail. 

2) fly pi lite v2 mount.stl

to mount the SoC to the din rail. 


3) z drive cover.stl

4) 2020 extrusion cover and lower side cable holder

a small section of the cover used on the bottom side of the extrusion A can serve as motor cable holder, to hide the motor cable easily without exposure.
