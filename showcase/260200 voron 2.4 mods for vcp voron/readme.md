after vcp (vibration cementitious printing) achieved relatively good flowrate control, it is time to update the motion system from i3 gantry to a VORON2.4 fix bed, in order to isolate the vibration of the nozzle and frame from the bed on which the printed part sits. 

it is not just switching toolhead and x carriage of a standard VORON2.4 since a fix bed is still not good enough for vibration isolation. a separate bed, or say, an independent bed, is wanted. 

to achieve a separate bed, the original electronic compartment of VORON2.4 needs to be moved to somewhere else (i chose the rear of the printer), and more covers are needed to prevent cementitious materials from splashing out on the printer, which would be difficult to clean up. 

so, there will be mods serving the said purposes. and this folder is currently for the placement of the mods before further documentations.
