At first, the student found me online and asked for a printing of u-shape plates as part of his device to holding sensors. 

tbh, i knew well that wasn't the right way of using FDM. but anyway it's a process for the student to try and learn. i held my opinions back and simply provided what was asked for.

some time later on, the student wanted to make a "prototype" of the device. i wasn't sure what that meant exactly, probably just about the same function holding the sensors. 

this time the student came and we discussed about the design of the device. but sadly the student didn't bring the sensors or anything here, so i couldn't do any measurement and can only talk through the details by checking on some photos. 

we did have problems finding out what the student actually wanted. the alignment of different sensors mattered? the mcu to be where? what was the stuff in the bowl of the U shape? without the actual device and sensors, none of these questions were well answered. 

anyway, i drew this and printed for the student right away.

(the dark yellow cylinders were supposed to be the sensors)

the student was surprised that could be done so quickly and nicely. but sadly, that was the end. a loose end. the student didn't come back with the device or request anything else. so, i don't know what's the after story. does it fit? what about the cam? what about the mcu (said to be an ESP32)? sealing? well, i don't ask if they don't talk initiatively. as a service provider, i try to be a tool without asking too much.

well, for our service, it's free, no need to pay money or paperwork, but at least you should pay attention to providing the information for CAD modelling and describe your needs in a clear way.
