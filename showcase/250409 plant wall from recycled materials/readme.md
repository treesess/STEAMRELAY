by using the recycled aluminium extrusions (not standard ones) connected by FDM prints and some concrete some accessories, a 1500x140x1700 plant wall was built. 

this mobile wall with casters uses very little space but has a large capacity to hold the greens. it features adjustable planter orientation which is convenient for observation, watering and changing lighting conditions for the plants.
