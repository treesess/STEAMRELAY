previously we printed the bubble/air diffuser for mini aquarium, then we need to position it into the water. 

here is my solution.

of course there were solutions provided by the aq shops, it's just i don't quite like the suction cup.

this positioner is easy printing and providing handle for the part of tube out of water. and, with a heat gun, you can bend it as you want.
