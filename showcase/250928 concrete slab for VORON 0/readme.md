previously i used recycled woodplates to make similar slabs for my VORON 2.4 and 0.2. 

This time a printed mold was tried.

The CAD model was too simple to introduce (just a block with chamfer and fillet).

it's printed by PETG in vase/spiral mode.

printed and cast. 

not like the wood mold method, this way was so, so quick and smooth. the least attention was paid with a very great result came out. 

and yes due to the pressure of fresh concrete, the plastic mold was a bit bulged - this was not unexpected but served as a kind of stylish part of this design. 


(you don't even need to calculate how much concrete do you need since in CAD the property list of the solid part just tells you the answer)
