first thing off, get a container for the LSR. this kind of container should be tailor-made for the actual plant. or you will not be able to get the plant fully wrapped by LSR or wasting too much LSR to filling excessive space. 

split cover serves as the positioner of the plant. use the hot melt glue to finalize the fixing.

the plant's lower part with its roots and soil should be wrapped up properly (with some opening for air around the root/soil part for the plant to breathe), so that the plant doesn't get hurt in the progress.

then the split cover positioner should be up. 

then, sorry, some steps without photos here. then you put the plant upside down and loaded in the container, cast fully mixed LSR, seal up with hot melt glue. all seal up. 

next, is a tricky one: **flip the whole thing downside up** and hang it to somewhere waiting for the LSR to become SSR.

the above photo was what i did but you don't need that much glue. i used that much glue only because the print was leaking LSR and i had to take some exaggerated measures to make sure it stop leaking. 

better wait for a day to demold. don't worry, the plant will be fine. 

for demolding, all i can say is, gentle, gentler, and a bit more careful. it's okay to cut the SSR mold if needed (if you cannot take the plant out in one piece, you probably can't get any cast out in one piece later).

this is the one i made. of course it's hard to imagine why it's like this. feeling weird? you can only cast some resin/plaster to find out.
