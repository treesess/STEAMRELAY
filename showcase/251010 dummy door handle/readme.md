there was a door, with its lock and handle off for some reason. the door had door closer (self-closing mechanism), therefore it'd be not convenient to open it with that hollow hole left. 

so a door handle was needed.

a symmetric one with a similar shape to the original metal handle was drawn.

printed and installed with M5 screws and a shaft (just something unused by my hand, not a particularly wanted thing).

and the other half of sphere too. 

it's made strong and tried feeling well open the door rn.
