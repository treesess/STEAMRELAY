This was done as a training to myself. 

Take M3x8 SHCS as an example:

This single capture of CAD drawing basically tells everything about this topic. 

If there are something more to tell, check out the slicer with no additional support needed:

Add a PAUSE command (Klipper) at certain layer, and insert the M3x8 screw inside, then finish up the printing. 

This capture of drawing shows how a screw was buried inside:

The lower outer cylindrial part is the support and can be easily removed after the printing. 

(perhaps upload some photos of the make later...)
