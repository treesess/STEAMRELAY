Some door signs of PULL made of metal plate got rusty and/or fell due to old age.

Previously some colleagues tried to use laminated paper prints to fix this problem. It worked for a while but fell or was sucked by the humid/rainy days of HK. 

Therefore a plastic solution was adopted this time. It's easy to draw one and print it out:

For better looking, more perimeter/wall counts are recommended to avoid zigzag infill pattern on the top layer. Of course, some slicers now can choose the type of infill on top of the print.

Then add a PAUSE command to switch colors manually (i hope i have X1CC):

Here we go:

Metal ones should be more durable than plastic prints maybe, while plastic prints are better than laminated paper prints i guess.
