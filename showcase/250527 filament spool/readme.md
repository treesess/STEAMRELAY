happened to buy the ESUN filament without spool. so have to print one so that we can use the filament. 

there are many spool designs online. tbh i don't like them... i did print one of the online spool before, it fitted, but used too much print time and material, and, used a buckled design which was not durable. 

so i drew my own:

and printed in 4 hours:

it has a proper tolerance and uses 3x 35 mm M3 screws to fastened to two parts. 

robust, quick, and cheap.
