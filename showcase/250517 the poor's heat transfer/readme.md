The goal is to transfer the print on normal A4 paper to the other surface (e.g., concrete, plastic, wood etc). Here we do it to the concrete one. 

it's the poor's, only the cheapest tools and materials are used. 

first, we do a thin concrete plate for practicing. you may find a unused wood and cast some concrete on it then vibrate it to a circle-ish thin plate.

then, you need: 

1) find a laser 2d printer (just a very common used one) to print out mirrorred pattern. don't use heavy paper, the thinner the better. 

2) baking paper can be found in your kitchen or a supermarket. 

3) soldering iron with a flat tip is good. 

4) a cup of water.

then it's done like this:

um... well, the process is a bit tricky, i may do a video to show the how later. 

the main point is: 

1) the lasered ink is resin in nature which melts at about 200 â„ƒ.

2) the paper fiber disintegrates in water easily (especially alkaline liquid with heat)

3) heat transfer requires pressure and heat. 

so, basically we melt the resin ink and press it onto the concrete surface, cool it down without removing the paper so that the ink is sticked to the concrete. finally use water to disintegrate the paper fiber so that only the ink is left on the concrete.
