don't be silly trying die stone before hands on ordinary gypsum. because the operational time is shorter, giving you very small window for error. but the die stone is very fine and hard and better water resistance. 

well i m silly i tried the die stone first.

the above shows the first 4 very defective cast. most of the tips were off. 

but the 5th is good enough. very yellow (means mixed well), most tips are there, almost no bubbles.

------

now is the method time for the difficulty of de-bubble. 

a) as i tried, vacuum might not be effective for die stone. and air might flow back if you operate it wrongly. 
b) vibration is the key. use power tools to do this. do it as much as possible before the plaster sets. both before and after casting, especially after casting. 
c) if time allows, direct dig-out of air trapped at the tips is the way to ensure the quality. (of course for such a complicated mold there will be no time for that)
