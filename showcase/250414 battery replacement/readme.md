the batteries for the remote control of air conditioner were dead. they were two AAA batteries. 

using DC power supply could be easier actually. to be honest, i was tired of looking for batteries. and, do you ever feel wrong using those batteries that you know they are likely to go to the landfill... i don't like that feeling.

replacing the AAA with DC supply is easy. used a DCDC converter to adjust the voltage for the remote. feels much better. 

and for the clock as well:

here i used the dummy bat model from https://www.printables.com/model/418706-aa-aaa-battery-dummies-for-dc-power 

no more frustration when i saw the clock not turning again.
